<p> My first impression of the site wasn't the best. I am a big Trader Joe's fan--I love their style and vibe. I feel like the vibe of the webiste is a bit bare, with less focus on the cool stuff they have and more on recipes. </p>
<p> The site's organization matches their wesbite's vibe: minimalistic. It There are only 5 drop down links, with most of them being things divorced from the store itself. </p>
<p> I think the site's structure confuses me a little bit as I feel the focus is on recipes rather than products or promotions (which is usually the purpose of a grocery store) </p>
<p> The site graphics/layout/multimedia is the saving grace of this site. I've been very negative about my review, but I really do feel like Trader Joe's vibe comes through in its design.</p>
<p> The load time was reasonable, maybe 3 seconds. </p>
<p> The text color was good! The background color was just a bland white, which I felt took away from the overall design.</p>
<p> The site has a small navigation bar and it is pretty well done. Just a little bit random.</p>
<p> The website's color scheme was consistent but nothing out of the ordinary. Just white and red. Definitely repeated throughout the website.</p>
<p> There is definitely a responsive design in place with the wesbite. When I resize the window, the products stay lines up and some lesser important things are hidden or moved to a different layout.</p>
<p> The site has a few unusual features. I thought the focus on recipes and podcast was a different direction from what is expected from a grocery store. Overall it is a very minimalistic site </p>
